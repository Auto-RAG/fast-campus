      "1. **Lease Sales**: The Secretary must conduct at least one lease sale annually from 2009 to 2013.\n",
      "2. **Pipeline Construction**: The Secretary of Transportation will facilitate the construction of necessary pipelines for oil and gas transport, ensuring environmental responsibility.\n",
      "3. **Natural Gas Pipeline**: The President is tasked with coordinating efforts to construct a natural gas pipeline from Alaska to U.S. markets, capitalizing on substantial gas reserves.\n",
      "4. **Project Labor Agreements**: Pipeline operators must negotiate project labor agreements to ensure labor stability and efficiency in maintenance and construction.\n",
      "5. **Export Ban**: The act repeals prior provisions allowing the export of Alaskan oil and re-establishes prohibitions on crude oil exports.\n",
      "6. **New Leases Requirements**: New leases for exploration/production will only be issued if the applicant is actively developing existing leases or has relinquished non-active leases.\n",
      "7. **Fair Return on Production**: The Secretary of the Interior will ensure prompt and accurate royalty payments from lessees and propose legislative improvements for royalty collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the Act emphasizes sustainable development and management of Alaska's petroleum resources while regulating lease issuance and maintenance compliance.\n",
